## Media Queries:



## JavaScript Array Functions:
 ### **Map** : 
 - The `map()` method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array. 
 - In the callback, **_only the array element_** is required. Usually some action is performed on the value and then a new value is returned.
  ### **Filter** :
  - The `filter()` method takes each element in an array and it applies a **_conditional_** statement against it. If this conditional returns **true**, the element gets **pushed** to the output array, if false, it doesn't.
  - The syntax for filter is similar to map, except the callback function should return true to keep the element, or false otherwise. In the callback, only the element is required. 

## CSS Framework:


## Hmtl DOM Manipulation:
