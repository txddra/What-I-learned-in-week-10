## Media Queries:
 - Media query is a CSS technique, that can be used to check many things, such as:

    - _width and height of the viewport_
    - _width and height of the device
    orientation_ (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
    - _resolution_
 - It uses the  `@media` rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

## JavaScript Array Methods:
 ### **Map** : 
 - The `map()` method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying a function to each one of the elements of the first array. 
 - In the callback, **_only the array element_** is required. Usually some action is performed on the value and then a new value is returned.

  ### **Filter** :
  - The `filter()` method takes each element in an array and it applies a **_conditional_** statement against it. If this conditional returns **true**, the element gets **pushed** to the output array, if false, it doesn't.
  
  - The syntax for `filter` is similar to `map`, except the callback function should return true to keep the element, or false otherwise. In the callback, only the element is required.

- **Bootstrap** is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
